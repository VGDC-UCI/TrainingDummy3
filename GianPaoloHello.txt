We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
I've got commitment that I'm thinking of
Don't want to be just like any other guy
I just want to tell you how I'm feeling,
Got to make you understand

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie, and hurt you
